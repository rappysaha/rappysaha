I was working with Virtualbox 6.1 with ubuntu distribution 18.04. The display resolution was too small and I wanted to change it by following this [post](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/make-virtualbox-full-screen/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20fix%20this,CD%20drive%20of%20the%20VM.&text=Now%20you%20can%20maximize%20the,of%20the%20Windows%2010%20guest.). I did not follow accordingly, and I just tried to install Guest edition from the following option.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
