  <h1 class="page-heading">Research Interrest</h1>
  Currently, I am working as Post Graduate Researcher in the University of Glasgow. My research areas are implement an efficient quantization method on edge FPGAs for machine learning workloads, analyze the impact of approximate computation on edge accelerator design for machine  learning workloads, investigate the effects of sparsity and quantization on edge accelerator design for machine
  learning workloads.
  <!-- I am currently working on application-based video system development using SoC and have background in commercial product development.
  In addition to that, I have hands-on experience in image processing algorithm development in FPGA. I am always passionate about learning new technology.
  I am also interested in learning Embedded AI, specially, on the topic of improvement of the inference capability of a trained network in FPGA. -->
