  <h1 class="page-heading">Research Interrest</h1>
  I am currently working on application-based video system development using SoC and have background in commercial product development. In addition to that, I have hands-on experience in image processing algorithm development in FPGA. I am always passionate about learning new technology. I am also interested in learning Embedded AI, specially, on the topic of improvement of the inference capability of a trained network in FPGA. To quest this thirst for knowledge and to keep me up-to-date, I always try to review new research papers in this field despite having a full-time job. I love to contribute to the research community, to do so, I am serving as a technical committee member of Audio/Video Systems and Signal Processing <a href="https://ctsoc.ieee.org/technical/technical-committees/avs-tc.html">[AVS]</a>. <br><br>
